# Haskell Scraper

## Short description of what you attempted to build
I wanted to learned how to program in a functional paradigm because of some things I had heard regarding increased safety in functional languages due to static typing and immutable state. I picked Haskell as the functional language and decided to try scraping the CS98 assignment page for the weekly summaries.

I found two tutorial which seemed to provide slightly different approaches to the same problem. One illustrated how to use a popular Haskell scraping library called Scalpel and the other used a different library but incorporated command line inputs:
 - [Using Scalpel to build a simple web scraper with Haskell](https://gutier.io/posts/programming-tutorial-haskell-web-programming/)
 - [Scraping websites with Haskell](https://taylor.fausak.me/2015/05/21/scraping-websites-with-haskell/)

I quickly realized I needed an introduction to Haskell and worked through several chapters of the online book [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).

The end goal was to allow a user to enter a integer in the command line (between one and ten) and return the weekly assignment summary.

## What you learned
I learned the basics of functional programing and Haskell syntax. Additionally, I learned the general structure of a functional programing web scraper.

## What didnâ€™t work
 - I was unable to install any of the Haskell packages required for the web scraper tutorials I was following. Haskell's package manager `Cabal` would not behave correctly -- likely an unfortunate side effect of the way I initially set up my environment. After a couple hours of debugging the issue I wrote it off as a loss.
 - Attempting to learn functional programing and produce a working project was a little too ambitious for ten hours.
